# Task
Write a little application, which should be a todo management system. It should show a list of multiple tasks. Each list can hold single tasks or sublists of tasks.
Each entity should include all CRUD-operations. A single task can be marked as done/undone. A tasklist can also be marked as done/undone. If a tasklist is marked as done, it should also mark every sublist or subtask as done.
No view is required, any dump is ok. Please do not invest more than 1-2 hours
If you have any cool features in mind, feel free to include.
